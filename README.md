## ðŸ’­ Comicfy - Hack the Valley 7 

#### Comicfy.AI aims to turn any piece of fiction, historical account, or life story into a visual experience (in the format of a comic strip).

The front-end of our application was developed using React. We utilised multi-threading with Python in the backend to concurrently make requests to the Wombo Dream API and Cohere's API. We also built an algorithm to determine to most relevant sentences in a story. Our back-end is built using FastAPI (Python framework) to integrate everything together!

Our team of 4 ended up demo-ing this project at HTV 7, and although we didn't win (ðŸ˜¢), we learned a whole lot about APIs, HTTP requests, and general software development!
